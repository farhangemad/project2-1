* AI chatbot name P.A.L (Personal Assistant in Learning) to answer questions such as "What is Spring?" and "What is Hibernate?" 
* Spring Quiz of 17 Questions with Immediate results
* View score history and get cumulative average from PAL asking "How am I doing?"

To-do list:
* Train PAL on a large text dataset of questions and answers for it learn responses to more questions

## Getting Started
   
* The project uses an AWS RDS with a PostgreSQL database
### Clone Repository
* Copy the HTTP link

* For Windows, open your commend line interface
* `cd` into your intended local repo
* `git clone <link>`
* For Unix, open git bash
* Change working directory to your intended local repo
* `git clone <link>`
* Separate the front and backend builds into separate folders
### Open in IDE

* You can now run the backend
### Get the frontend (AngularBuild) running
- Install [Node.js] which includes [Node Package Manager][npm]
- npm install -g @angular/cli
- If you are using a Windows terminal, consider running "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass" to be to run scripts
- Run `cd ./project_name` 
- Run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install the Angular CLI
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies. 
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
